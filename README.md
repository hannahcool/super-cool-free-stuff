Hello!
I have spend far too much time online researching piracy-and-free-stuff related sites and apps,
and so I thought I would make this to try to share that knowledge with people.
Some of this stuff is piracy, some of it is just free.
I really care about UI for some reason so for the apps and programs I also included how good the UI is in my opinion in the descriptions.
If you have any recommendations, put them in Issues!

Games:

DDL:
[Steamrip](https://steamrip.com/) a ton of games;
[Gamdie](https://gamdie.com/) specifically indie games. please don't pirate indie games unless you actually can't afford them!;
[Online Fix](https://online-fix.me/) online multiplayer patches;

Repacks:
[Hydra Launcher](https://hydralauncher.fun/) launcher and downloader for repacks | Great UI;
[FitGirl Repacks](https://fitgirl-repacks.site/) Really good repacks;
[Dodi Repacks](https://dodi-repacks.site/) Also really good repacks, slightly larger file size;

Software:
[m0nkrus](https://w14.monkrus.ws/) the best site for Adobe piracy;

Media:
[movie-web](https://mw.lonelil.ru/) my favorite site for movie and tv-show piracy;
[watch.lonelil](https://watch.lonelil.ru/) another really good movie and tv-show piracy site. this one has live tv support, but is sometimes glitchy for me;

Mobile:
[Mobilism](https://forum.mobilism.me/) modded apks. has an android app. | Dogshit UI;
[Cloudstream](https://recloudstream.github.io/csdocs/) my favorite app for movie and tv-show piracy on android. in my experience, the best repository is SoraStream from the Hexated extension. | Pretty good UI;
[Lucky Patcher](https://www.luckypatchers.com/) patch apps to get free in-app purchases | Bad UI;
[Kvaesitso](https://kvaesitso.mm20.de/) my favorite app launcher. super easy to use. | Super good UI;
